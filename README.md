This my extension of a school project, for my CSC 307 class at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
My group members were: George Saro, James Kwan, Justin Herrera, and Kort Heyneman

I have forked a copy of it, and am continuing my work, because it was a good project, and I would like to see it to a state where I can call it well completed.

The aim is to make it a Dungeons and Dragons lookalike, see the wiki for more.
If you are reading this, feel free to play it and enjoy it. This is a work in progress, so it will be broken at times...
